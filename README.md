User Story:
As a bootcamp student, I want a platform that allows me to easily collaborate with my classmates on coding projects during classroom activities, so that we can efficiently work together in real-time, share resources, and receive instant feedback from instructors.

Key Features to Support This User Story
Real-Time Collaborative Code Editor:

Description: A code editor that allows multiple students to write and edit code simultaneously. The editor should include syntax highlighting, real-time cursor tracking, and commenting features to facilitate communication about the code.
Benefit: Enables students to collaborate directly on code in real time, mimicking pair programming or group coding sessions.

Live Coding Challenges and Peer Review:

Description: Feature live coding challenges where students can solve problems in real-time and then engage in peer review, providing feedback on each otherâ€™s solutions.
Benefit: Promotes active learning and critical thinking by allowing students to learn from each other's approaches and coding styles.


Live Project Management Dashboard:

Description: A project management dashboard folders/files that students can update in real-time. It can track progress on activities and projects.
Benefit: Helps students organize their work and manage project timelines effectively, even during short classroom activities.

Version History and Code Rewind:

Description: A version control system that logs changes in real-time and allows students to revert to previous versions of their code. This feature should also include annotations to explain changes.
Benefit: Provides a safety net for experimentation and learning, enabling students to undo mistakes and understand the evolution of their code.

Resource Sharing and Annotation:

Description: A centralized space for sharing resources like documents, links, and code snippets, with options to add annotations or comments on shared items.
Benefit: Facilitates resource-sharing among students and allows them to learn from each other's research and insights.

Web Development Templates:

Static Website Template: Includes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with a basic structure to start a static website.
React or Vue.js Application Template: Comes with pre-installed dependencies like React or Vue.js, Webpack, and Babel configurations.
Full-Stack Web Application Template: A template that includes both front-end and back-end setups, such as React or Angular with Express.js and a database connection (e.g., MongoDB, MySQL).

REST API Template: Pre-configured with Node.js and Express, including middleware setups like CORS, body-parsing, and basic authentication.

Time Efficiency: Users save time on setup and configuration, allowing them to focus on actual coding and development.

Consistency Across Teams: By using standardized templates, teams can ensure consistency in their codebase and project structure, reducing onboarding time for new team members.

Learning Enhancement: Beginners can learn faster by starting with well-structured templates that demonstrate best practices in project setup and code organization.

Reduced Errors: Pre-configured environments reduce the likelihood of setup-related errors and compatibility issues, streamlining the development process.

Improved Collaboration: Teams can collaborate more effectively with a shared understanding of the project structure, dependencies, and configuration settings.
